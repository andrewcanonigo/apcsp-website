<p> Some Basic Linux Commands: </p>

<li>cd: This command allows the user to switch between directories. For example, if the user has a directory named, "read", the user can type, cd read,
        and he/she will be able to create files inside the "read" directory.</li>
<li>ls: This command allows the user to see a list of all the directories and files that are saved on the home page. The user can type ls, and a list like
        "read, tmp, and workfile," may show up. </li>
<li>clear: If the user types in the word "clear", then the whole page will show a blank slate. This is used for organization purposes.</li>
<li>w: IF the user types in the letter, it will show who is logged in and what they are doing. For example, when I typed in the letter w, I saw that the users
        sp1b and sp1a were logged in. </li>
<li>sleep: If the user types in the word sleep in the terminal, then the program will be delayed for a certain amount of time. For example, typing in sleep
        3 would make the computer "sleep" for 3 seconds. </li>
<li>man: This command allows the user to access the reference manual. It will allow the user to type in man ls, and a description of how the ls command works
will be shown. </li>
<li> ps: This command allows the user to see which processes are currently running. For example, if a user wanted to see if the sleep command was still running,
then he/she will see the word sleep pop up and how long it has been running for. </li>
<li> history: if a user types in the word history, then he/she will be able to see all of the commands and processes that occurred in the past session. For example,
the user will see sleep commands and nano commands if they accessed files or decided to make the session sleep. </li>
<li> ping: This command allows the user to see if a user is alive or not. For example, the format would look like this: $ ping host-name/IP </li>
<li> kill: This command allows the user to essentially cease any currently running processes. For example, if the command "sleep" was running, then the user
can kill the sleep process. </li>
