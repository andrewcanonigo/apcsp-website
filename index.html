<p>Bio:</p>
<p> I am a senior at Canyon Crest Academy. I love music and love playing the violin, piano, and the drums. I also really enjoy watching and playing basketball.
        purple is my favorite color. I aspire to be a Naval Officer one day and would love to be a fighter pilot. My favorite movie is the Dark Knight, and I love 
        watching anime. I will most likely be going to UCSD. </p>
